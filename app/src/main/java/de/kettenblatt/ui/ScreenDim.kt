/**
 * Screen dimming between turns.
 *
 * On a long straight there is nothing on screen worth looking at, and the panel
 * is the single biggest power draw on a bar-mounted phone. This blacks the map
 * out and drops the backlight to its minimum until something needs attention.
 *
 * **What this is not:** an app cannot switch the panel off. Doing that needs
 * device-admin rights, and waking it again afterwards is unreliable across
 * manufacturers. What it does instead is draw full black and set the backlight to
 * minimum, which on the Pixel's OLED means almost every pixel is genuinely off --
 * visually and, near enough, electrically. The advantage over letting the system
 * time out is that waking is instant and entirely under the app's control, so a
 * turn can bring the screen back with no keyguard in the way.
